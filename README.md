# Kalman-Filters
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a Kalman filter for sensor data fusion. Kalman filtering is used for estimating the state of a system by combining noisy sensor measurements with a predictive model. This project showcases the application of Kalman filtering to predict and enhance position and velocity data.
